Her doctoral thesis is a genome-wide study of functional brain imaging as part of the ENIGMA consortium. This involves working with a diverse team of collaborators to coordinate the project, and the development of computational methods to deal with combining diverse datasets into a common analysis framework. One important result of my project is the software HALFpipe, of which she is the lead developer. HALFpipe performs automated data analysis for functional brain imaging data and is widely used within the ENIGMA consortium.`
